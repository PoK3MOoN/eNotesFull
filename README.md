<h1>📕 E-NOTES APP 💾</h1>
<h3>🥇 Welcome to my first fullstack application. </br> 🎨 I used MERN stack + Tailwind CSS 🏄‍♀️ to make this project. </br> 
  There are many functions implemented, such as registering your own account 🎭, making your notes along with sorting and searching functions 🎯, your personal info panel to edit your credentials and 
much more! 😎</h3>
<h3> You can check live application on following url: https://najbolji-notes.netlify.app/login (Netlify + Render) </h3>
<h4>NOTE: Since I am using free application to host server, on the first enterance you should click login and wait 30 seconds for red text (in order to wake up server) </h3>
<h3>I can't wait to show you my app, so hurry up and visit this one until someone break it (Password update is currently not working)😅</h3>
